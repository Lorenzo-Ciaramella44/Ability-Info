Welcome
To start everything, download the files: config (the program starter) and id_ed25519 (SSH key) on your prompt, after that you have only to digit in this order 
# "chmod +x config"
# "source config"
and receive the results.

The file config sets the SSH key to the SSH Agent, that is linked to the my repository Lorenzo-Ciaramella44/Ciaramella, after that the programm copies the folder "Ciaramella" 
and enters in the folder and gives to you reading, writing and executing the file ex_pro and the file ex_pro.py.
How you will see, it asks to you if you want to start the program. If only the answer is 'YES' the program config starts the programm ex_pro. 
The programm ex_pro downloads the file 'Nemo_6670.dat' and asks to you to select the file that you want to analyzed (yes, it could be a little repetitive), when you select
the correct file it ends and starts the programm ex_pro.py.
The programm ex_pro.py, before the analysis, transforms the file 'Nemo_6670.dat' in a txt file that python codes are able to read.
In fact without these command lines (from 1 to 83) python is not able to read the file. After that the programm analyzes and produces 3 images that satisfy the quests.

I hope everything works perfectly.
